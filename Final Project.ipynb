    "A new technical sales representative for a winery products company has been assigned a new territory. She is to contact and develop sales relationships with wineries in the Pacific Northwestern United States. She seeks to establish new relationships and develop her new sales territory. However, the Pacific Northwestern United States includes both Washington State and Oregon State. The area encompasses vast areas and not all areas are viticulture areas or vineyards. How can she best expand her territory to include new clients?"

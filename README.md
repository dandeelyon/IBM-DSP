# Wine Industry Market Development using Machine Learning

This repo is a market penetration analysis demonstration including a data set from an open source found on Kaggle and an Application Programming Interface (API) hosted by FourSquare. I used DBSCAN as my machine learning component for this study. This is a proof of concept made in my spare evenings during the Summer of the COVID19 pandemic.

The repo includes a powerpoint presentation and pdf report of the work presented in the python code.

# IBM-DSP
IBM Data Science Professional

This is the IBM Data Science Professional Repo for Daniel A. Dycus. In this repo, I cover my capstone for the IBM-DSP certification and showcase this information for others. I performed a market penetration analysis for a theoretical supplier of products for the wine industry. I used DBSCAN for my machine learning component.

The repo includes a powerpoint presentation and pdf report of the work presented in the python code.
